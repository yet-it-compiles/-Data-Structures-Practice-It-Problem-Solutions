// SOLUTION 1

//(Fix 1) =  make sure to remove the redundant int s 
//(Fix 2) =  // consturctors don't have return typespecifier
//(Optional Fix 3) decide if you like to refer to fields with this.

 public Point(int initialX, int initialY) {
    this.x = initialX;  
    this.y = initialY;
}

// OR

// SOLUTION 2
 public Point(int initialX, int initialY) {
