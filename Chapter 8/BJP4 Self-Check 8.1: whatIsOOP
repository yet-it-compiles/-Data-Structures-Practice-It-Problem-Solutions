/**
 Which of the following is an important difference between object-oriented programming and procedural programming?
 */
 
 1) Object-oriented programming is only possible in Java and not in other languages such as C++.
 2) Procedural programming treats a program as a sequence of actions or commands, while object-oriented programming looks at a program as a group of interacting entities named 
 objects with related data and behavior.
 3) Object-oriented programming is more powerful and capable of solving a larger class of computational problems than procedural programming, which is much more limited and 
 unable to be used in large projects.
 4) Object-oriented programming was invented by Microsoft Corporation while procedural programming is invented by Apple for use on Macs.
 5) Procedural programming is slower and less efficient than object-oriented programming.
