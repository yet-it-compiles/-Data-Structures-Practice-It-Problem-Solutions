Create a class called Name that represents a person's name. The class should have fields named firstName representing 
the person's first name, lastName representing their last name, and middleInitial representing their middle initial 
(a single character). Your class should contain only fields for now.

In order for Practice-It to properly test your class, make sure to use exactly the class name and field names described 
previously. Also make sure to declare your fields using appropriate types.
