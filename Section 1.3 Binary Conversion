Section 1.3
// Introduction To Binary Number Conversions

Binary numbers are used within Computers to read and store data. They are typically kept in either an on or off state/charge. 
Thus, we denote a 0 as an "off" and 1 as an "on", for its charge or state. 

The Binary Counting System Translates, in laymen terms, as a number, multiplied by 2, 

We Start at 1, then 2, then multiplying each term thereafter by a factor of 2. 
Such that we get: 

0   1   2   4   8   16   32   64   128   256   512   1024   2048   4096      

Using this system we are able to translate any number, into a binary equivalanet

100 	| 4
1011  |	11
101010  | 42
1001110  | 78
