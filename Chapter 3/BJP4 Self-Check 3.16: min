/**
 Write a method called min that takes three integers as parameters and returns the smallest of the three values,
 such that a call of min(3, -2, 7) would return -2, and a call of min(19, 27, 6) would return 6.
 Use Math.min to write your solution.
 
 Lessons
 -   What you have to realize here is that the Math.min() method only can take in and compare two values at a time. 
 Therefore, to solve this problem you will have to have the method encapsulate another and return the value.
